**Cannabis** is an annual, dioecious, flowering herb.
It survives for only one growing season, then relies on seeds to sprout the following spring.
It has both male and female plants. Males produce pollen, while pollinated females produce seeds.
Both males and females produce 'flowers'. 

Males produce negligible amounts of THC, so growers typically remove male plants from their garden unless they want to produce seeds. A pollinated female will produce less THC than an unpollinated one, due to the fact that energy is being used to produce seeds. 
A single female plant can produce hundreds of seeds, a single male plant can pollinate hundreds of female plants. 

**4 Things Cannabis Plants Need**
1. Warmth: Optimal temp range is 75F to 86F (24C to 30C). Temperatures above or below this range can result in stunted growth and degraded quality.
2. Light: Cannabis is photosensitive, it begins to flower when the day length reaches a ratio of 12 hours light to 12 hours dark, in the autumn. Controlling light is an advantage of inddor growing.
3. Water: Most tap water will work for growing cannabis, but plants can be damaged by high chlorine levels in certain cases. 
4. Nutrients: Different life cycles utilize different percentages of the full spectrum of nutrients. Early growth stage requires more nitrogen, later flowering stage requires more phosphorous. Providing constant supply of full spectrum is all that is necessary.
